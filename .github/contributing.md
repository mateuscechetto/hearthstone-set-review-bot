## Features and Bug Fixes

If there's a change you'd like to contribute, follow the README to get started with running the project locally. Before contributing any code, make sure you've had a chance to understand the codebase, as well as how to properly use Angular, Node, and MongoDB.

Create a new branch for your contributions, ideally with the name `users/{your-username}/{feature-name}`. Try to keep a single branch focused on one change, whether a feature or a bug fix. Before submitting a PR, review the PR checklist and make sure your changes pass all relevant tests.
